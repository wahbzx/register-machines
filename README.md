# Register Machines

A Haskell implementation of the Register Machines taught in the 2nd Part of the Models of Computation Course

Some Background:

A register machine (sometimes abbreviated to RM) is specified by: 
- finitely many registers R<sub>0</sub>, R<sub>1</sub>, . . . , R<sub>n</sub>, each capable of storing a natural number;
- a program consisting of a finite list of instructions of the form *label : body* where, for i = 0, 1, 2, . . ., the (i + 1)<sup>th</sup> instruction has label L<sub>i</sub>. 

The instruction body can take one of three forms:

- R<sup>+</sup> -> L′ - Add 1 to the contents of Register R and jump to instruction L'
- R<sup>-</sup> -> L′, L'' - If the contents of R > 0, then subtract 1 and jump to L′, else jump to L′′
- HALT - Stop Executing Instructions

## An Example

This example is `comp1` in the Haskell code, and the table on the left can be generated by running
```
runShowAllStates comp1
```
